Hi! My name is Dhroov Patel and I'm a senior at the University of Michigan studying Data Science.
I'm interested in web development and mobile app development!
Currently, I'm taking Web Systems and Database Management Systems at my university.
My repos on Github are private, but my personal website, dhroovpatel.com, has public projects on GitFront.
